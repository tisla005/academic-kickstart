# About Me

Taufiq is a Computer Science undergraduate currently in his final semester attending Florida International University. He's driven by the idea that the limits of technology are endless; and with the right know-how, one person can change the entire world. Taufiq's passion for technology sparked at a young age when his father brought home his first computer and taught him about the wonder of computing. Since then, he's built numerous computers from scratch, mastered various programming languages, designed several websites, and built software applications for multiple companies in South Florida. He plans to specialize in software engineering and eventually branch into a role in cybersecurity.
